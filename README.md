## Recipes

This is an Android project written in Kotlin.

This application allows you to save recipes easily and conveniently, replacing both physical and digital notebooks. The recipe list is collaborative and shared by all users.

## Features

The application allows you to register the first time you use it, and then navigate to a list of recipes. This list will have a social media format.
If you are already registered, you will go directly to the main list. It also allows you to log out to enter with another account.
When you are in the recipe list, you can enter the recipe you select and view it in more detail, including its ingredients, preparation, etc.
From the main list, you also have the option to create a new recipe.

## Functionality

When you start the application, the Splash screen appears during the loading time.
